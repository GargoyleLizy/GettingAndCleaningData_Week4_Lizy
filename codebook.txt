This codebook is dedicated about how to produce the cleaned data from UCI HAR
Dataset.

The week4cleaned.txt contains mean and standard deviation of each measurements
that mentioned in features.txt for each activity and subject.
  - First row contains the variables names.
  - Each observation take a row.
  - variable activity ranges from 1-6 and subject range from 1-30.
  - other variables are mean and standard deviations of each measurement for
  the activity and the subject.

Selected features for each activity and subjects are :
  "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
  "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
  "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
  "tBodyAcc-std()-X"
  "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
